# Data Structures in Java Projects
Projects from Data Structures in Java course at Columbia University

## Included projects
- **Animal** -- Game for guessing an animal. First time the game will guess one animal that it knows, 
but with each game, the computer learns. Every time the computer gets the animal wrong it will ask for its name 
and what makes it different from the animals it knows. The computer uses this information to make a decision tree 
which it traverses each game.
- **Hearts** -- The hearts card game.
- Smaller projects and utilities: linked lists, sorting, encryption, IO, etc.
